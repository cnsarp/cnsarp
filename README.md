## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Cansu and I'm a Data Science bootcamp graduate interested in all things related with Data Analytics/Science. 
- Before transitioning into the world of data, I worked as a Production Manager/Engineer in the laser industry. âš¡ðŸ’¡
- ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to an Omdena [Project](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/standardized-comparision-of-urban-green-space-mapping-through-remote-sensing) focused on identifying urban green spaces using deep learning techniques. 
  My team is responsible for implementing the U-Net model with InAmp for image segmentation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also learning more details about CNN with this great course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
