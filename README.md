## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Cansu and I'm a Data Science bootcamp graduate interested in all things related with Data Analytics/Science. 
Before transitioning into the world of data, I worked as a Production Manager/Engineer in the laser industry. âš¡ðŸ’¡
- ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to an Omdena Project focused on identifying urban green spaces using deep learning techniques. 
  My team is responsible for implementing the U-Net model with InAmp for image segmentation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also diving deeper into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), exploring different architectures to expand my expertise.
